My name is Shuyi Zheng and I am a second year graduate student in Computer Science. I have one year working experience as a data analyst in China and familiar with data related language like Python. Although I do not have direct experience as a SDE, I have written some scripts with Python last semester and familiar with data structure and basic algorithms. I hope I can expand my experience on coding and learn more about real-world software development process  from this course.
