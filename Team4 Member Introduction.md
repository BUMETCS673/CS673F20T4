### Hussain Alibrahim (hmalibra@bu.edu)

**Role: Configuration leader**

My name is Hussain Alibrahim and I am a first year graduate student in Computer Science. I graduated my bachelors degree in June 2020 in Computer Science, and hopefully after my masters degree I will pursue a phd. I specialize in Java mostly and know how to code in Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, Javascript, and more. I am always ready for a new project for me to bloom into a finished product I'd be proud of. I hope to further my understanding of software engineering in this course as well as develop more teamwork skills.
